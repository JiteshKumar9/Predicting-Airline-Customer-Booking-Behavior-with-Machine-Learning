## Project Overview
This project aims to predict whether a customer will make a booking based on historical data. Using machine learning techniques, we analyze key factors influencing customer booking behavior and build a predictive model to assist airlines in making data-driven decisions.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is 'customer_booking.csv', which contains various features related to customer interactions and bookings. The target variable is 'booking_status', indicating whether a customer made a booking.

## Project Structure
- **Data Exploration & Preprocessing**: Cleaning and encoding categorical features.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating additional meaningful features to enhance the model.
- **Model Training**: Using a RandomForestClassifier to predict customer bookings.
- **Evaluation & Visualization**: Measuring model performance and explaining feature importance using SHAP values.
- **Presentation**: Summarizing key insights in a PowerPoint slide.

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, SHAP)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Machine Learning (Random Forest Classifier)
- GitHub for version control
